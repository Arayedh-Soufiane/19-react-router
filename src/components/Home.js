      <h1>Dear Fans,</h1> 
      You know we upload Full Software Setup in a single direct link from our
      servers. Even if the Setup size is 50 GB. This is not an easy task as it
      sounds. Because when thousands of users start downloading these large
      files, we have to add more servers to handle the bandwidth. Therefore we
      have to pay huge rent on a monthly basis to keep these servers up and
      running.</div>
      <div>
      Secondly, we hate to give any third party free file sharing links because
      they can be dead sooner or later. Although they are free, we donâ€™t use
      them. Because after six months or so, all free links can be dead. Same is
      the case with torrents which can become dead eventually and there are no
      seeders.</div>
      <div>
      That is why we decided to take the hit on our own and rented servers for
      you. So that you can download unlimited files with a single direct link.
      But with the growing file sizes, this is getting hard for us, because we
      have to rent more and more servers to handle the bandwidth. I would also
      like to add that we spend huge time testing software before uploading. So
      that you may not face any problems.</div>
      <div>
      So now we need your support. This will help us to pay the monthly rent of
      our servers. You can pay as less as $1. Because every penny counts. Please
      pay as much as you can and show your love ðŸ™‚
